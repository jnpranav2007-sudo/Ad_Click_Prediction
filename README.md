# Ad_Click_Prediction
My first machine learning project ,predicting ad clicks using Logistic Regression with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
# 🚀 Ad Click Prediction using Logistic Regression  

### 🧠 My First Project — Internship Training (1st Year)

This project marks the beginning of my journey into **Machine Learning and Data Science**.  
It focuses on predicting whether a user is likely to click on an online advertisement using **Logistic Regression**.

## 📊 Project Overview

Online advertisements play a major role in digital marketing.  
By analyzing user data such as **age, income, time spent online, and internet usage**,  
we can predict the probability of a user clicking on an ad.  

This project demonstrates how predictive modeling helps companies optimize ad campaigns and improve targeting efficiency.
